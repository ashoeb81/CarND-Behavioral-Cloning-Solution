# Behavioral Cloning Project

## Data

To generate the data used for this project, I drove the car around both tracks for multiple laps (at least 4 laps around both tracks 1 and 2).  The driving involved both centerline driving as well as recovery from weaving out to the right and left edges of the road.  My driving generated a dataset of 9622 frames with their associated steering angles.  These frames were <bold> shuffled and split </bold> into a training (7698 frames), testing (962 frames), and validation (962) sets.
